## How to use the script
1. Copy file <em><strong>run_analysis.R</strong></em> to your R working directory <br/>
2. Launch R and type: <em><strong>source("run_analysis.R")</strong></em> <br/>
3. In case UCI HAR Dataset is not in your working directory the script will download the data set from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and uznip in your working directory (in UCI HAR Dataset subdirectory)    
4. Wait until R script is finished (it may takes a few minutes especially if data is to be downloaded).  
5. Once the script is finished, a new file <em><strong>tidy_data.txt</strong></em> is created in your working directory.  The structure of this file is described in <em><strong>CodeBook.md</strong></em> document.
